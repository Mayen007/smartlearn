## üöÄ Next Steps

**Phase 5: Parent/Teacher Dashboard**

- Low-code dashboard integration (Glide, Airtable, Supabase)
- Progress tracking and performance analytics
- Student engagement monitoring
- Learning outcome reporting

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **OpenAI API Key Required**: AI features won't work without a valid API key
- **API Costs**: Be aware of OpenAI API usage costs
- **Rate Limits**: Consider implementing rate limiting for production use
- **Fallback Mode**: App works with fallback responses when AI is unavailable
- **Session Storage**: Currently uses in-memory storage (use Redis/database for production)
- **Data Persistence**: Session data is lost on server restart (implement persistent storage for production)
- **Quiz Generation**: AI-generated quizzes require OpenAI API access

## üìû Support

For questions or issues:

- Check the current phase implementation
- Review the code comments for guidance
- Ensure all dependencies are properly installed
- Verify your OpenAI API key is correctly configured
